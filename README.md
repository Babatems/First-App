# First App

Welcome to **First App**! This is a Dart application that you can clone to your IDE and run on a virtual device. It prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Dart SDK: You can download and install it from the official website: [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- Flutter SDK: You can download and install it from the official website: [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your preferred location on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/first_app.git
cd first_app
```

Replace "your-username" in the URL with your actual GitHub username.

## Running on a Virtual Device

Follow the steps below to run **First App** on a virtual device:

1. Open your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as Android Studio or Visual Studio Code.

2. Ensure you have the Dart and Flutter SDKs properly configured in your IDE. Refer to the official documentation for your IDE on how to set up Dart and Flutter support.

3. Start your virtual device using an emulator or simulator. You can do this through the Android Virtual Device Manager (AVD) in Android Studio or the iOS Simulator on Xcode for macOS.

4. In your IDE, open the cloned project folder, which should be named "first_app".

5. Locate the `main.dart` file inside the `lib` folder. This file contains the entry point of the application.

6. Right-click on `main.dart` and choose "Run" or "Debug" from the context menu.

7. Select the virtual device you want to run the app on. If prompted, choose the virtual device you previously started.

8. The app will be installed on the virtual device, and you should see the "Hello, World!" output in the virtual device's console.

Congratulations! You have successfully cloned the **First App** repository to your IDE and run the app on a virtual device.

Feel free to explore the code, customize the app, and experiment with Dart and Flutter to build amazing applications.
